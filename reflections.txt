Q. How long did you spend working on this project?
A. I didn't count all hours, but I guess it took not more than 4-5h

Q. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
A. Frankly, none of challenge was so hard. But I was very happy about the idea of this project.

Q. What two additional features did you build? Why?
A. I did finding transaction by some key value pair (like customer_name: 'Walter Latimer') and reutrning an item. First one is very helpful for second one; and I think that none of retailer works without returning item ability.

Q. Where do you still have room to grow?
A. Well, I would say everywhere. F.e. those three classes has many similarities and share almost same logic, so it would be good to create some generic class and inherit from it.
